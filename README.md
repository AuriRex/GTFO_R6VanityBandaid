# GTFO_R6VanityBandaid

R6 `SERVER SYNC` stuck fix.

### "Features":
 - No more constant flashing `SERVER SYNC`
 - Unlocks all clothing items locally
   - (This does not give you any items in other versions!!)
 - removes boosters in this version completely
   - (You're still able to earn boosters but you can't see your progress or use them)
 - Clothing items should also be unlockable but I am literally unable to test this
   - (And once again you can not see your unlocks in this version)

# Installation

Download latest `BepInExPack` from [Thunderstore](https://gtfo.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_GTFO/) and unzip the contents of the `BepInExPack_GTFO` folder from inside the zip archive into your R6 GTFO folder.

Download the mod from the [releases page](https://github.com/AuriRex/GTFO_R6VanityBandaid/releases) and place it into `BepInEx/plugins/`.
